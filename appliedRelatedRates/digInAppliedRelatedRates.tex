\maketitle

Now we are ready to work related rates problems in context. Just as
before, we are going to follow essentially the same plan of attack in
each problem.


\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{Draw a picture.}] If possible, draw a schematic picture with all the relevant information. 
\item[\textbf{Find equations.}] We want equations that relate all
  relevant functions.
\item[\textbf{Differentiate the equations.}] Here we will often use
  implicit differentiation.
\item[\textbf{Evaluate and solve.}] Evaluate
  each equation at all known desired values and solve for the relevant
  rate.
\end{description}



\section{Formulas}


\begin{example}
A hand-tossed pizza crust starts off as a ball of dough with a volume
of $400\pi\, \text{cm}^3$. First, the cook stretches the dough to the
shape of a cylinder of radius $12$ cm. Next the cook tosses the
dough.

If during tossing, the dough maintains the shape of a cylinder and the
radius is increasing at a rate of $15$ cm/min, how fast is its
thickness changing when the radius is $20$ cm?
\begin{explanation}
  To start, \textbf{draw a picture}. Here we see a cylinder that
  represents our pizza dough.
  \begin{image}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[penColor,very thick] (0,0) ellipse (2.5 and .8);
    \draw[very thick,penColor] (-2.5,-.5) arc (180:360:2.5 and .8);% bottom
    \draw[penColor] (0,0) -- (2.5,0);
    \draw[penColor,very thick] (-2.5,0) -- (-2.5,-.5);
    \draw[penColor,very thick] (2.5,0) -- (2.5,-.5);
    \node[above,penColor] at (1,0) {$r$};
    \node[below,penColor] at (1,0) {$r' = 15$};
    \draw[decoration={brace,raise=.2cm},decorate,thin] (2.5,0)--(2.5,-.5);
    \node [penColor,right] at (2.7,-.25) {$h$};
    \node [penColor,left] at (-1.5,1.2) {$V = 400\pi$ cm$^3$};
    \node [penColor, right] at (1.5,-1.42) {$V = \pi\cdot r^2 \cdot h$ cm$^3$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{image}
  Next we need to \textbf{find equations}. We see that we have
  \[
  400\pi = \answer[given]{\pi \cdot r^2 \cdot h},
  \]
  which immediately simplifies to
  \[
  400 = r^2 \cdot h.
  \]
  Imagining that $r$ and $h$ are functions of time, we now may write
  \[
  400 = r(t)^2 \cdot h(t)
  \]
  and so we may now \textbf{differentiate the equation} using implicit
  differentiation, treating all functions as functions of $t$,
  \[
  0 = 2\cdot r(t) \cdot r'(t) \cdot h(t) + r(t)^2 \cdot h'(t).
  \]
  Now we'll \textbf{evaluate and solve}. We know that $r(t) =
  \answer[given]{20}$ cm and that $r'(t) = \answer[given]{15}$
  cm/min. Moreover, we can now find $h(t)$ as we have
  \[
  400 = r(t)^2 \cdot h(t) \qquad{meaning}\qquad h(t) = \frac{400}{r(t)^2}.
  \]
  Since $20^2 = 400$, we see that $h(t) = 1$. Substituting in, we see
  \begin{align*}
    0 &= 2\cdot 20 \cdot 15 \cdot 1 + 20^2 \cdot h'(t),\\
    -2\cdot 20 \cdot 15  &= 20^2 \cdot h'(t),\\
    \frac{-2\cdot 20 \cdot 15}{20^2}  &= h'(t)\\
    -1.5  &= h'(t).
  \end{align*}
  Hence the thickness of the dough is changing at a rate of $\answer[given]{-1.5}$
  cm/min.
\end{explanation}
\end{example}



\begin{example}
  Consider a melting snowball. We will assume that the rate that the
  snowball is melting is proportional to its surface area. Show that
  the radius of the snowball is changing at a constant rate.
  
\begin{explanation}
  To start, \textbf{draw a picture}.
  \begin{image}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      %\draw[penColor!50!background,very thick] (0,0) ellipse (2 and 1);
      \draw[very thick,penColor!20!background] (2,0) arc (0:180:2 and .7);% top half of ellipse
      \draw [penColor, very thick] (0,0) circle [radius=2];
      \draw[penColor] (0,0) -- (2,0);
      \node [below,penColor] at (1,0) {$r$ cm};
      \draw[very thick,penColor] (-2,0) arc (180:360:2 and .7);% bottom half of ellipse
      \node [penColor,left] at (-1.5,1.42) {$V = \frac{4}{3}\cdot \pi \cdot r^3$};
      \node [penColor, right] at (1.5,-1.42) {$A = 4\cdot \pi \cdot r^2$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{image}
  Next we need to \textbf{find equations}. The equations we'll use are
  \[
  V = \answer[given]{(4/3) \cdot \pi \cdot r^3} \qquad\text{and}\qquad A = \answer[given]{4\cdot
  \pi \cdot r^2}.
  \]
  Now the key words are ``the rate that the snowball is melting is
  proportional to its surface area.'' From this we have the following
  equation:
  \begin{image}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node at (0,0) {
      $\underbrace{V'} =  \overbrace{k} \cdot \underbrace{A}$
    };
    \node at (-1.6,-.7) {\small{rate the snowball is melting}};
    \node at (.1,.7) {\small{is proportional to}};
    \node at (1.7,-.7) {\small{its surface area}};
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{image}
  So we need to know $V'$. We know $V = \frac{4}{3}\cdot \pi\cdot
  r^3$. If we imagine $r$ as a function of $t$, we can write volume as
  a function of $t$:
  \[
  V(t) = \frac{4}{3}\cdot \pi\cdot r(t)^3
  \]
  so
  \[
  V'(t) = 4\cdot \pi\cdot r(t)^2 \cdot r'(t).
  \]
  Now we'll \textbf{evaluate and solve}. We now know
  \[
  V'(t) = 4\cdot \pi \cdot r(t)^2 \cdot r'(t) =  k\cdot 4\cdot
  \pi \cdot r(t)^2 = k\cdot A(t).
  \]
  So
  \begin{align*}
  4\cdot \pi \cdot r(t)^2 \cdot r'(t) &=  k\cdot 4\cdot
  \pi \cdot r(t)^2\\
  r'(t) = k.
  \end{align*}
  Hence the radius is changing at a constant rate. 
\end{explanation}
\end{example}





\section{Right triangles}

\begin{example}
A plane is flying directly away from you at $500$ mph at an altitude
of $3$ miles.  How fast is the plane's distance from you increasing at
the moment when the plane is flying over a point on the ground $4$
miles from you?


\begin{explanation}
To start, \textbf{draw a picture}.
\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[penColor2, dashed, very thick] (0,0) -- (5,4);
%\draw[penColor, dashed, very thick] (0,0) -- (0,4);
\draw[penColor, dashed, very thick] (5,0) -- (5,4);
\draw[penColor, dashed, very thick] (0,0) -- (5,0);
\draw[->,penColor, very thick] (1,4) -- (6,4);
\draw [penColor, fill] (5,4) circle [radius=.07];
%\node [left,penColor] at (0,0) {\scalebox{3} \Ladiesroom};
%\node [right,penColor] at (6,4) {\scalebox{3}{\ding{40}}};
\node [right,penColor] at (5,2) {$3$ miles};
\node [above,penColor] at (3,4) {$p'(t) = 500$ mph};
\node [above,penColor] at (5,4) {$p(t)$};
\node [below,penColor] at (2.5,0) {$4$ miles};
\node [left,penColor2] at (2.4,2) {$s(t)$ miles};
\draw [penColor, fill] (0,0) circle [radius=.07];
\node [left,penColor] at (-.1,0) {You};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}
Next we need to \textbf{find equations}. By the Pythagorean Theorem
we know that
\[
p^2+3^2=s^2.
\] 
Imagining that $p$ and $s$ are functions of time, we now
\textbf{differentiate the equation}. Write
\[
2\cdot p(t)\cdot p'(t)  = 2\cdot s(t) \cdot s'(t).
\] 
Now we'll \textbf{evaluate and solve}.  We
are interested in the time at which $p(t)=\answer[given]{4}$ and $p'(t) =
\answer[given]{500}$. Additionally, at this time we know that $4^2+9=s^2$, so
$s(t)=\answer[given]{5}$.  Putting together all the information we get
\[
2(4)(500)=2(5)s'(t),
\]
thus $s'(t)=\answer[given]{400}$ mph.
\end{explanation}
\end{example}



\begin{example}
A road running north to south crosses a road going east to west at the
point $P$.  Cyclist $A$ is riding north along the first road, and
cyclist $B$ is riding east along the second road.  At a particular
time, cyclist $A$ is $3$ kilometers to the north of $P$ and traveling
at $20$ km/hr, while cyclist $B$ is $4$ kilometers to the east of $P$
and traveling at $15$ km/hr.  How fast is the distance between the two
cyclists changing?


\begin{explanation}
We start the same way we always do, we \textbf{draw a picture}.
\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[->,penColor!50!background, very thick] (-1,0) -- (4,0);
\draw[->,penColor!50!background, very thick] (0,-1) -- (0,4);
\draw[->,penColor, very thick] (0,3) -- (0,4);
\draw[->,penColor, very thick] (3,0) -- (4,0);
\draw [penColor, fill] (0,0) circle [radius=.07];
\draw [penColor, fill] (3,0) circle [radius=.07];
\draw [penColor, fill] (0,3) circle [radius=.07];
\draw[dashed,penColor2, very thick] (3,0) -- (0,3);

%\node[penColor,rotate=90,right] at (.5,3) {\scalebox{-2} \Bicycle};
\node[penColor,right] at (0,.2) {$P$};
\node[penColor,left] at (-.3,3) {$a'(t) = 20$ km/hr};
\node[penColor,left] at (0,1.5) {$3$ km};
\node[penColor,below] at (1.5,0) {$4$ km};
\node[penColor,below] at (4,0) {$b'(t)= 15$ km/hr};
\node[penColor2,above] at (1.6,1.6) {$c(t)$};
%\node[penColor,right,above] at (3.5,0) {\scalebox{-2}[2] \Bicycle};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}
Here $a(t)$ is the distance of cyclist $A$ north of $P$ at time $t$,
and $b(t)$ the distance of cyclist $B$ east of $P$ at time $t$, and
$c(t)$ is the distance from cyclist $A$ to cyclist $B$ at time $t$.

We must \textbf{find equations}.  By the Pythagorean Theorem,
\[
c(t)^2=a(t)^2+b(t)^2.
\] 
Now we can \textbf{differentiate the equation}. Taking derivatives we
get
\[
2c(t)c'(t)=2a(t)a'(t)+2b(t)b'(t).
\]
Now we can \textbf{evaluate and solve}.  We know that $a(t) =
\answer[given]{3}$, $a'(t) = \answer[given]{20}$, $b(t) =
\answer[given]{4}$ and $b'(t) = \answer[given]{15}$. Hence by the
Pythagorean Theorem, $c(t) = \answer[given]{5}$. So
\[
2\cdot 5 \cdot c'(t) = 2 \cdot 3\cdot 20 + 2 \cdot 4 \cdot 15
\]
solving for $c'(t)$ we find $c'(t) = \answer[given]{24}$ km/hr.
\end{explanation}
\end{example}



\section{Angular rates}

\begin{example}
A swing consists of a board at the end of a $10$ ft long rope.  Think
of the board as a point $P$ at the end of the rope, and let $Q$ be the
point of attachment at the other end.  Suppose that the swing is
directly below $Q$ at time $t=0$, and is being pushed by someone who
walks at 6 ft/sec from left to right.  What is the angular speed of
the rope in rad/sec after 1 sec?


\begin{explanation}
To start, \textbf{draw a picture}.
\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.3]
\draw[penColor!50!background, very thick] (0,3) -- (0,-1);
\draw[penColor, very thick] (0,3) -- (2.12,-.12);
\draw [penColor!50!background, very thick] (-2.12,-.12) arc [radius=3, start angle=225, end angle= 315];
\draw [penColor2, very thick] (0,2.3) arc [radius=.7, start angle=270, end angle= 305];
\draw[->, penColor, very thick] (0,-.12) -- (2,-.12);

%\node[penColor] at (2.12,-.12) {\scalebox{3} \Ladiesroom};
\draw [penColor, fill] (2.12,-.12) circle [radius=.07];
\node[penColor,right] at (2.3,-.12) {$P$};
\node[penColor,right,above] at (0,3) {$Q$};
\node[penColor,right] at (1.06,1.5) {$10$ ft};
\node[penColor,above] at (1,-.12) {$\dd[x]{t} = 6$ ft/sec};
\node[penColor2,right,above] at (.3,2) {$\theta$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}
Now we must \textbf{find equations}. From the right triangle in our
picture, we see
\[
\sin(\theta)=\answer[given]{x/10}.
\]
We can now \textbf{differentiate the equation}. Taking derivatives we obtain 
\[
\cos(\theta)\cdot \theta'(t)=0.1 x'(t).
\]
Now we can \textbf{evaluate and solve}.  When $t=1$ sec, the person
was pushed by someone who walks $6$ ft/sec. Hence we have a $6-8-10$
right triangle, with $x'(t) = \answer[given]{6}$, and
$\cos\theta=8/10$. Thus
\[
(8/10) \theta'(t) =\answer[given]{6/10},
\]
and so  $\theta'(t)=\answer[given]{3/4}$ rad/sec.
\end{explanation} 
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  The Palace of Westminster in London has a large clock tower.  The
  minute hand is $4.2$ meters long and the hour hand is $2.7$ meters
  long. At what rate is the distance between the tip of the hands is
  changing when the clock strikes $3$ pm?
  \begin{hint}
  Recall the \textit{Law of Cosines}: Given a triangle with sides
  lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$,
  \begin{image}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \coordinate (A) at (0,2);
      \coordinate (B) at (2,5);
      \coordinate (C) at (6.5,2);
      \draw[very thick,penColor] (A)--(B)--(C)--cycle;
            
      \tkzMarkAngle[penColor,size=0.6cm,thin](C,A,B)
      \tkzLabelAngle[penColor,pos = 0.35](C,A,B){$\theta$}

      \tkzDefMidPoint(A,B) \tkzGetPoint{a}
      \node [left] at (a) {$a$};

      \tkzDefMidPoint(A,C) \tkzGetPoint{b}
      \node [below] at (b) {$b$};

      \tkzDefMidPoint(B,C) \tkzGetPoint{c}
      \node [right,above] at (c) {$c$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{image}
  we then have
  \[
  c^2 = a^2 + b^2 -2ab\cos(\theta).
  \]
  \end{hint}

  \begin{explanation}
    To start, we \textbf{draw a picture}.
    \begin{image}
      \begin{tikzpicture}
        \coordinate (A) at (0,2.7);
        \coordinate (B) at (0,0);
        \coordinate (C) at (1.6,0);
        \draw [penColor,very thick] (A)--(B)--(C);
        \draw [penColor, dashed] (0,0) (C)--(A);
        \draw [penColor, very thick] (0,0) circle [radius=3];
        \tkzMarkAngle[size=.6cm,thin](C,B,A)
        \tkzLabelAngle[pos = .3](C,B,A){$\theta$}
        \tkzDefMidPoint(A,B) \tkzGetPoint{m}
        \tkzDefMidPoint(B,C) \tkzGetPoint{h}
        \tkzDefMidPoint(A,C) \tkzGetPoint{d}
        \node [left] at (m) {$m$};
        \node [below] at (h) {$h$};
        \node [right] at (d) {$d$};
      \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{image}
    Now we must \textbf{find equations} that combine relevant
    functions. Initially we might suppose that
    \[
    d^2 = m^2 + h^2;
    \]
    however, here $\theta$ is function of time, so this relationship
    only holds for certain times. Hence we must use the Law of Cosines
    to write
    \[
    d^2 = \answer[given]{m^2 + h^2} - 2mh\cos(\theta).
    \]
    To find $\theta$, imagine we are measuring the angle starting at
    ``twelve o'clock'' with $t$ being measured in hours. Then letting
    $\theta_m$ be the angle made by the minute hand and $\theta_h$ be
    the angle made by the hour hand we have
    \begin{align*}
      \theta_m(t) &= \answer[given]{2\pi \cdot t},\\
      \theta_h(t) &= \frac{2\pi}{12}\cdot t =\frac{\pi}{6}\cdot t.
    \end{align*}
    Finally since $\theta$ is decreasing, as the minute hand is
    traveling faster than the hour hand,
    \[
    \theta(t) = \theta_h(t) - \theta_m(t).
    \]
    On the other hand, $m$ and $h$ are constants. We may now write
    \[
    d(t)^2 = m^2 + h^2 - 2mh\cos(\theta(t)).
    \]
    If \textbf{differentiate the equations} using implicit
    differentiation we find
    \[
    \theta'(t) = \answer[given]{\frac{\pi}{6}-2\pi}
    \]
    and
    \[
    2\cdot d(t) \cdot d'(t)  = 2mh\sin(\theta(t))\cdot \theta'(t).
    \]
    Now we \textbf{evaluate and solve}.  We know that $m=4.2$,
    $h=2.7$, $\theta'(t) = \frac{-11\pi}{6}$, and since the time is $3$
    pm, $\theta(t) = \pi/2$. Thus
    \[
    d(t) \cdot d'(t)  = \answer[given]{4.2}\cdot 2.7\cdot \frac{-11\pi}{6}.
    \]
    on the other hand
    \[
    d(t) = \sqrt{4.2^2 + 2.7^2}
    \]
    and so
    \[
    d'(t) = \frac{4.2\cdot 2.7\cdot \frac{-11\pi}{6}}{\sqrt{4.2^2 + 2.7^2}}.
    \]
    This is the desired rate in units of meters per hour.
  \end{explanation}
\end{example}



\section{Similar triangles}


\begin{example}
  It is night. Someone who is $6$ feet tall is walking away from a
  street light at a rate of $3$ feet per second.  The street light is
  $15$ feet tall.  The person casts a shadow on the ground in front of
  them. How fast is the length of the shadow growing when the person
  is $7$ feet from the street light?

  \begin{explanation}
    To start, \textbf{draw a picture}.
    \begin{image}
      \begin{tikzpicture}
        \coordinate (A) at (6,2);
        \coordinate (B) at (0,5);
        \coordinate (C) at (0,2);
        \coordinate (D) at (2,2);
        \coordinate (E) at (2,4);
        \tkzMarkRightAngle(A,C,B)
        \tkzMarkRightAngle(A,D,E)
        \tkzDefMidPoint(A,B) \tkzGetPoint{a}
        \tkzDefMidPoint(A,C) \tkzGetPoint{b}
        \tkzDefMidPoint(D,C) \tkzGetPoint{x}
        \draw[decoration={brace,mirror,raise=.2cm},decorate,thin] (.2,2)--(1.8,2);
        \draw[decoration={brace,mirror,raise=.2cm},decorate,thin] (2.2,2)--(5.8,2);
        \draw[decoration={brace,raise=.2cm},decorate,thin] (0,2)--(0,5);
        \draw[dashed] (A)--(B)--(C)--cycle;
        \draw[very thick] (D)--(E);
        \draw[very thick] (D)--(A);
        \draw[very thick] (B)--(C);
        \node[left] at (2,3) {$6$};
        \node at (1,2-.5) {$p(t_0)=7$};
        \node at (4,2-.5) {$s(t)$};
        \node at (0-.5,3.5) {$15$};
        \draw [fill] (0,5) circle [radius=.07];
      \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{image}
    Here $t$ is the variable and $t_0$ is the specific time when
    $p(t_0) = 7$.
    
    Now we need to \textbf{find equations}. We use the fact that we
    have similar triangles to write:
    \begin{align*}
      \frac{s(t)+p(t)}{\answer[given]{15}} &= \frac{s(t)}{\answer[given]{6}},\\
      6\cdot s(t) + 6 \cdot p(t) &= 15\cdot s(t),\\
      6\cdot p(t) &=9\cdot s(t),\\
      2\cdot p(t) &=3 \cdot s(t). \\
    \end{align*}
    Now we must \textbf{differentiate the equation}. We should use
    implicit differentiation, and treat each of the variables as
    functions of $t$. Write
    \[
    2\cdot p'(t) =3 \cdot s'(t)
    \]
    At this point we \textbf{evaluate and solve}. Since the person is waling at a rate of $3$ feet per second, we may write
    \[
    2\cdot 3 = 3 \cdot s'(t),
    \]
    and cancel to see that $s'(t) = \answer[given]{2}$, meaning the shadow is growing
    at a rate of $2$ feet per second.
  \end{explanation}
\end{example}





\begin{example}
Water is poured into a conical container at the rate of 10
cm${}^3$/sec.  The cone points directly down, and it has a height of
30 cm and a base radius of 10 cm.  How fast is the water level rising
when the water is 4 cm deep?

Note, no attempt was made to draw this picture to scale, rather we
want all of the relevant information to be available to the
mathematician.

Now we need to \textbf{find equations}. The formula for the volume of
a cone tells us that
\[
V = \frac{\pi}{3} r^2 h.
\]
Also the dimensions of the cone of water must have the same
proportions as those of the container.  That is, because of similar
triangles,
\[
\frac{r}{h}=\frac{10}{30} \qquad\text{so}\qquad r=\answer[given]{h/3}.
\]  
Now we must \textbf{differentiate the equation}. We should use
implicit differentiation, and treat each of the variables as functions
of $t$. Write
\[
\dd[V]{t} = \frac{\pi}{3}\left(2rh \dd[r]{t} + r^2 \dd[h]{t}\right)
\qquad\text{and}\qquad \dd[r]{t} = \frac{1}{3}\cdot \dd[h]{t}.
\]
At this point we \textbf{evaluate and solve}. We plug in $\dd[V]{t} =
\answer[given]{10}$, $r = \answer[given]{4/3}$, $\dd[r]{t} = \frac{1}{3}\cdot \dd[h]{t}$ and
$h=\answer[given]{4}$. Write
\begin{align*}
10 &= \frac{\pi}{3}\left(2\cdot \frac{4}{3}\cdot 4 \cdot\frac{1}{3}\cdot\dd[h]{t} + \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^2 \dd[h]{t}\right)\\
10 &= \frac{\pi}{3}\left(\frac{32}{9}\dd[h]{t} + \frac{16}{9} \dd[h]{t}\right)\\
10 &= \frac{16\pi}{9}\dd[h]{t}\\
\frac{90}{16\pi} &= \dd[h]{t}.
\end{align*}
Thus, $\dd[h]{t}=\answer[given]{\frac{90}{16\pi}}$ cm/sec.
