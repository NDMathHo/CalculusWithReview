The functions you are most familiar with are probably polynomial
functions.

\section{What are polynomial functions?}

\begin{definition}
  A \dfn{polynomial function} in the variable $x$ is a function
  which can be written in the form
  \[
  f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1 x + a_0
  \]
  where the $a_i$'s are all constants (called the \dfn{coefficients})
  and $n$ is a whole number (called the \dfn{degree} when $n\ne
  0$). The domain of a polynomial function is $(-\infty,\infty)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{question}
  Which of the following are polynomial functions?
  \begin{selectAll}
    \choice[correct]{$f(x) = 0$}
    \choice[correct]{$f(x) = -9$}
    \choice[correct]{$f(x) = 3x+1$}
    \choice{$f(x) = x^{1/2}-x +8$}
    \choice{$f(x) = -4x^{-3}+5x^{-1}+7-18x^2$}
    \choice[correct]{$f(x) = (x+1)(x-1)+e^x - e^x $}
    \choice{$f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 3x + 2}{x-2}$}
    \choice[correct]{$f(x) = x^7-32x^6-\pi x^3+45/84$}
  \end{selectAll}
\end{question}

The phrase above ``in the variable $x$'' can actually change.
\[
y^2-4y +1
\]
is a polynomial in $y$, and
\[
\sin^2(x) + \sin(x) -3 
\]
is a polynomial in $\sin(x)$.


\section{Multiplying}

Multiplying polynomials is based on the familiar property of arithmetic, \dfn{distribution}: $\displaystyle a\cdot( b + c ) = ab + ac$.
\begin{example}
	Multiply $2x^3$ by $x^5 - 4x^4 + 7x - 2$.
	\begin{explanation}
		Use distribution.
		\begin{align*}
			2x^3 \left( x^5 - 4x^4 + 7x - 2 \right) &= 2x^3 \cdot x^5 - 2x^3 \cdot 4x^4 + 2x^3 \cdot 7x - 2x^3 \cdot 2\\
				&= 2 x^8 - 8x^7 + 14x^4 - 4x^3
		\end{align*}
	\end{explanation}
\end{example}


\begin{example}
	Multiply $3x^2 + 2x - 1$ by $2x^4 + 5x^3+ x + 1$.
	\begin{explanation}
		We'll start by distributing the first polynomial into the second.  Then we'll distribute back, and finish by combining like terms.
		\begin{align*}
			(3x^2+ 2x-1) \cdot (2x^4 + 5x^3 + x +1) &= 2x^4(3x^2+ 2x-1) + 5x^3 (3x^2+ 2x-1) + x (3x^2+ 2x-1) + 1(3x^2+ 2x-1)\\
				&= (6x^6 + 4x^5 - 2x^4) + (15x^5 + 10x^4 - 5x^3) + (3x^3+2x^2-x)+(3x^2+2x-1)\\
				&= 6x^6 + 19x^5 +8x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x^2+ x - 1
		\end{align*}
	\end{explanation}
\end{example}
The result is that we have multiplied every term of the first polynomial by every term of the second, then added the results together.  In the case of two
\dfn{binomials} (polynomials with only two terms), this is frequently referred to as \dfn{FOIL}.



\section{Factoring}
Factoring is a bit like an inverse operation of multiplying polynomials.  We start with the multiplied out polynomial, and ask what the individual factors were.

The easiest factors to deal with are common factors.
\begin{example}
	Factor $8x^5 + 40x^4 + 40x^3$.
	\begin{explanation}
		The coefficients of this polynomial have a greatest common divisor of $8$, and the least degree of the terms is $3$, so
		$8x^3$ is a common factor.  Taking this out leaves:
		$\displaystyle 8x^3( x^2+5x+5)$.
	\end{explanation}
\end{example}


For \dfn{trinomials} (polynomials with three terms) of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$, we try to factor as $(px+r)(qx+s)$.  We'll start with an example with $a=1$.
\begin{example}
	Factor $x^2+2x-24$.
	\begin{explanation}
		Since the leading coefficient is $1$, we want to factor $x^2+2x-24$ as $(x+r)(x+s)$.  That means, we are looking for two numbers that add to $2$,
		and multiply to $-24$.  Look at the different ways of multiplying two numbers to get $-24$:  $-1 \cdot 24$, $-2 \cdot 12$, $-3 \cdot 8$, $-4 \cdot 6$...
		That last one, $-4$ and $6$ are two numbers that add to $2$ and multiply to give $-24$.
		
		Our factorization is $x^2+2x-24 = (x-4)(x+6)$.
	\end{explanation}
\end{example}

The process is slightly more complicated when $a \neq 1$.
\begin{example}
	Factor $6x^2 + 11 x + 3$.
	\begin{explanation}
		In this case, we are looking for numbers that multiply to $6$ for our coefficients, and that multiply to $3$ for the constants in each
		factor.
		That is, we're looking at things like $(6x+1)(x+3)$, $(6x+3)(x+1)$, $(2x+3)(3x+1)$, $(2x+1)(3x+3)$.   Actually, that's about it, as $6$ can only
		factor as $1 \cdot 6$ or $2 \cdot 3$, and $3$ only factors as $1 \cdot 3$.
		All of these possibilities will give the right $x^2$ term and the right constant term.  The only difference is the $x$-term they give.  Do any of them
		give an $x$-coefficient of $11$?  Yes!
		
		$6x^2+11x+3 = (2x+3)(3x+1)$.
	\end{explanation}
\end{example}





Remember, a \dfn{root} of a polynomial function is an $x$-value where the polynomial is zero. The next theorem
above is a deep fact of mathematics. The great mathematician Gauss proved the theorem in 1799 for his doctoral thesis. 

\begin{theorem}[The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra]\index{Fundamental Theorem of Algebra}
  Every polynomial of the form
  \[
  a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1 x + a_0
  \]
  where the $a_i$'s are real (or even complex!) numbers and $a_n \ne 0$ has exactly
  $n$ (possibly repeated) complex roots.
\end{theorem}

\section{What can the graphs look like?}


The upshot as far as we are concerned is that when we plot a
polynomial of degree $n$, its graph will cross the $x$-axis at most
$n$ times.

\begin{example}
  Here we see the the graphs of four polynomial functions.
  \begin{image}
    \begin{tabular}{cc}
      \begin{tikzpicture}
        \begin{axis}[
          domain=-2:2,

          ymin=-2, ymax=2,
          width=2.5in,
          axis lines =middle, xlabel=$x$, ylabel=$y$,
          every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
          every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
          ]

          \node at (axis cs:1.2, 1 ) [penColor,anchor=west] {$A$};
        \end{axis}
      \end{tikzpicture}
      &
      \begin{tikzpicture}

          ]
	  \addplot [very thick, penColor2, smooth] {-5*x^5+5*x^4+5*x^3-4.25*x^2-.3*x +.5};

        \end{axis}
      \end{tikzpicture}\\
      \begin{tikzpicture}

	  \addplot [very thick, penColor3, smooth] {5*x^6-5*x^5-5*x^4+5*x^3+x^2 -.5};
          \node at (axis cs:1.2, 1 ) [penColor3,anchor=west] {$C$};
        \end{axis}

	  \addplot [very thick, penColor4, smooth,samples=100] {-5*x^6+5*x^5+5*x^4-5*x^3-x^2+1.5*x+1};
          \node at (axis cs:1.2, 1 ) [penColor4,anchor=west] {$D$};
        \end{axis}
      \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{tabular}
  \end{image}
  For each of the curves, determine if the polynomial has
  \textbf{even} or \textbf{odd} degree, and if the leading coefficient
  (the one next to the highest power of $x$) of the polynomial is
  \textbf{positive} or \textbf{negative}.
  \begin{explanation}\hfil
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Curve $A$ is defined by an
      \wordChoice{\choice{even}\choice[correct]{odd}} degree
      polynomial with a \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{positive}\choice{negative}}
      leading term.
    \item Curve $B$ is defined by an
      \wordChoice{\choice{even}\choice[correct]{odd}} degree
      polynomial with a
      \wordChoice{\choice{positive}\choice[correct]{negative}} leading
      term.
    \item Curve $C$ is defined by an
      \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{even}\choice{odd}} degree
      polynomial with a \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{positive}\choice{negative}}
      leading term.
    \item Curve $D$ is defined by an
      \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{even}\choice{odd}} degree
      polynomial with a \wordChoice{\choice{positive}\choice[correct]{negative}}
      leading term.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{explanation}
\end{example}


%% \section{Connections to inverse functions}

%% Polynomials only have inverse functions if they are
%% one-to-one. Pratically this means that polynomials of \textit{even}
%% degree are \textit{never} invertible since they are never
%% one-to-one. Odd degree polynomials may or may not be invertible. This
%% is worth repeating in the language of algebra, and we will write it as
%% a warning.

%% \begin{warning}
%%   Consider $f(x) = x^2$. Suppose we tried to find the inverse of
%%   $x^2$. In this case we plug $f^{-1}(x)$ into $f$ and write
%%   \begin{align*}
%%     f(f^{-1}(x)) &= \left(f^{-1}(x)\right)^2\\
%%     x &= \left(f^{-1}(x)\right)^2
%%   \end{align*}
%% at this point you may be tempted to say ``$f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{x}$'' but
%% this is not correct. The correct next line is:
%% \[
%% f^{-1}(x) = \pm \sqrt{x},
%% \]
%% but this \textbf{is not a function} from the real numbers to the real
%% numbers.
%% \end{warning}
